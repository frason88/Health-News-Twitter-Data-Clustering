## Abstract:

The data was collected in 2015 using Twitter API. This dataset contains health news from more than 15 major health news agencies such as BBC, CNN, and NYT.

## Data Set Information:

Each file is related to one Twitter account of a news agency. For example, bbchealth.txt is related to BBC health news. Each line contains tweet id|date and time|tweet. The
separator is '|'. This text data has been used to evaluate the performance of topic models on short text data. However, it can be used for other tasks such as clustering.
